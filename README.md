## About

This plugin is based on the open-source project [flipclock](https://github.com/AlynxZhou/flipclock), originally written in SDL. The original project provided a beautiful flipping clock effect, which I modified and adapted into an OBS plugin to bring this functionality directly into your streaming setup. Huge thanks to [AlynxZhou](https://github.com/AlynxZhou) for the original implementation.
